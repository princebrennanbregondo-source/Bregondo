  <h1>My Autobiography: Why I Chose Information Technology</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, I'm Prince Brennan Bregondo BSIT-J currently studying at University of Cebu Main Campus. I am 18 Years old 
    and the reason why I chose Information Technology as my course is because I grew curious about how things work,
    especially computers, phones, and apps we use every day. That curiousity slowly turned into passion for building,
    fixing, and improving technology.
    <br>
    Choosing IT course for me comes as my third option, because my mom and my dad wanted me to become a Sailor or take
    on a Custom course but since I have enrolled late and which I am glad for, I met this course 
  </p>

  <h2>Early Spark</h2>
  <p>
    My interest began when I was playing a game called Roblox, and i stumbled upon inspect when i right clicked on the game page
    and i saw words I've never saw before which was unclear and a mystery for me. I was 9 at that time. And that mystery became a fuel
    to my passion, I started learning about HTML in youtube and I even started making my own game on Roblox platform but I wouldn't really
    call it a proper coding because most things I did was change the terrain and add details through drag and put.  <br>
    From then on, I continued learning coding as my hobby
  </p>

  <h4>Goals in IT</h4>
  <p>
    In college, I want to strengthen my foundations in programming, networking, databases, and
    cybersecurity. My aim is to build projects that solve everyday problemsâ€”like automating tasks,
    building helpful websites then putting it all in my work portfolio as I aim a freelancing job 
    or companies seeking certain skill sets that I might have.

  <h6>Looking Ahead</h6>
  <p>
    My journey in IT is just the beginning, I am aware that I might face problems later on. Challenges and difficulties
    but that wouldn't stop me to achieve my dream of graduating and achieve success. <br>
    It isn't just my course but my passion and spirit for success
